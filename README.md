# cs416-narrative-visualization

This is my Narrative Visualization project for CS 416. Through this webiste, I haved visualized unicorn startups and their traits such as industry, country, and valuation. Each scene provides a different angle about the data. I have created a map visualizing the distribution of unicorns globally, a bar chart to identify industries with the highest valuations by country, and a line chart to show the trend in valuation over the years by country.
